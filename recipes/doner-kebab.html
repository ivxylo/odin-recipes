  <h2>Description</h2>
  <p>Classic <b>döner kebab</b>, et döner, consists of a heavily seasoned mixture of beef and lamb that is pureed into a paste, shaped into a log, and finally slow-roasted for hours on a vertical spit to juicy perfection. (Tail fat is often added to the meat mixture to keep it juicy and moist while it roasts.)

  <p>Nowadays chicken doner, or tavuk döner, is just as popular in Turkey. Chicken is similarly seasoned and marinated in a flavorful yogurt-based marinade, then stacked onto a vertical spit and slow roasted. 
  </p>
  <p>To serve doner kebab, the outer layer of charred meat goodness is thinly shaved off the spit, using a large, sharp knife, in a top-to-bottom motion. Yes, at that moment, the meat or chicken is meltingly tender and is made even more perfect when you add a warm, pillowy pita and flavorful fixings.
